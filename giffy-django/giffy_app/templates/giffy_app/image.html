    Remember the { for image in images } from the index.html?
    image is basically the Image model from the giffy_app/models.py
  -->
  <h3>{{ image.title }}</h3>
  <!--
    Django generates image url for us. Since the image here is
    just an instance of the Image model from the giffy_app/models.py
    we can access the underlying file by calling image.image
  -->
  <img src="{{ image.image.url }}" />
